# üåê PageRank Calculator

This project implements the **PageRank algorithm**, a method for ranking web pages based on their link structure.  
The project includes two methods to compute PageRank:

1. **Sampling-based estimation** ‚Äì Estimates PageRank using a random surfer model.  
2. **Iterative calculation** ‚Äì Computes PageRank iteratively using the PageRank formula until convergence.

## üìñ Overview

Given a corpus of HTML pages, each page may link to other pages. The goal of the PageRank algorithm is to determine the importance of each page based on incoming links:

- Pages with more incoming links from important pages receive higher PageRank.  
- A **damping factor** simulates a random surfer who either follows a link from the current page or jumps to a random page.  

The project contains three main functions:

1. **transition_model(corpus, page, damping_factor)**  
   Returns a probability distribution over which page a random surfer would visit next.  
   - Follows links from `page` with probability `damping_factor`.  
   - With probability `1 - damping_factor`, jumps to any page in the corpus randomly.  
   - If `page` has no outgoing links, chooses randomly among all pages.

2. **sample_pagerank(corpus, damping_factor, n)**  
   Estimates PageRank values by generating `n` random samples.  
   - The first sample is a random page.  
   - Subsequent samples are drawn using the transition model from the previous sample.  
   - Returns a dictionary mapping each page to its estimated PageRank (sum = 1).

3. **iterate_pagerank(corpus, damping_factor)**  
   Computes PageRank iteratively until convergence:  
   - Initialize each page with rank 1 / N.  
   - Update ranks based on contributions from all linking pages.  
   - Pages with no links are treated as linking to all pages.  
   - Stops when all PageRank values change by less than 0.001 between iterations.  
   - Returns a dictionary mapping each page to its final PageRank (sum = 1).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pagerank.git
cd pagerank
```
2. Install dependencies (if required):
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the PageRank program:
```python
python pagerank.py corpus
```
- `corpus` should be the path to a directory containing HTML files.
- The program outputs PageRank values computed by both sampling and iterative methods.
## üß© Dependencies / Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- No third-party modules required by default
- Optionally, you can use numpy or pandas for additional processing (not required for core functionality)

Example `requirements.txt`:
```python
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
```
## üí° Notes
- Damping factor is typically set to 0.85, simulating a random surfer.
- Number of samples affects the accuracy of the sampling method; default is 10,000.
- Both methods should produce similar PageRank results given the same corpus.

## üèÅ Credits
- Project inspired by CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (PageRank problem set).
- Designed for educational purposes to demonstrate probabilistic modeling and iterative algorithms.
